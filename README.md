# Spotify Roadtrip


A react app that allows users to create custom playlists to accompany them on a roadtrip based on artists from the places they pass through. 


---------------------

## Planning
### Notes
- *MVP* - you can type in location and select the artists from that location and manually add their songs to a playlist

- *Progression 1* - Enter desired playlist length (in time or track number), and auto generates a playlist from multiple artist from that area.

- *Progression 2* - Manually enter in all the areas you are driving through -  app can auto generate a playlist with the top artists from those areas.
  
- *Progression 3* - Able to add 2 locations (journey start and end point) and app will create a route from A to B and select 'x' number of location points between A and B and autogenerate playlist based on artists from those places.

- *Progression 4* - User accounts: add backend so users can create personal account and save playlists/journeys for posterity.
